this is the initial
import of the Free Media Tools (fmt) 
into GIT.
all changes are based on publically available sources to the jahshaka software.
some files are not properly copyrighted. 
I am still working on getting that fixed. but some files will have to be replaced.
We will need to remove all things Jah and all Logos etc.

Thanks to the savannah team for the support.
