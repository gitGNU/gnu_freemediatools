1. PREREQUISITES
====================

Here are the debian packages that I needed to have installed to build the package :

libavifile-0.7-dev
libc6-dev
libfreetype6-dev
libglew1.4-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
libmlt++-dev
libmlt-dev
libopenafs-dev
libqt3-headers
libqt3-mt-dev
libstdc++6-4.2-dev
libx11-dev
libxml2-dev
linux-libc-dev

1.1. The link command looks like this :
	-lmlt++ 
	-lmlt 
	-lpython2.4 
	-lGLEW 
	-lboost_filesystem 
	-lboost_iostreams 
	-lboost_regex 
	-lboost_thread 
	-lxml2 
	-lqt-mt 
	-laviplay 
	-lsqlite3 
	-lpthread 
	-ljpeg 
	-lfreetype 
	-lXmu 
	-lXi 
	-lXext 
	-lX11 
	-lGLU 
	-lGL 
	-lstdc++ 
	-lm 
	-lgcc_s 
	-lgcc 
	

2. By running ./configure, and Make, I build the ./FreeMediaTools application.


3. when you run it :
you will see lots of debug messages like this :
create a wstring/property_typenametest2:MFNode

4.then the program will exit, 
because it cannot open this dir, you need to create it like this :
mkdir -p ./openlibraries/install/share/jahshaka/database/
