Notes
-----

XP icons support large icons (up to 64x64) and alpha channel, older versions of windows do not.

1. open the xcf file in gimp.

2. save out as a png (it will be large size).

3. Scale it to 64x64 (switch off the ratio contraint) then re-save as png with a new name. 
   Undo, or reload to the original size, and repeat for 32x32 and 16x16.

4. Its wise to do the same at 8bit color depth, save again to different names. 

5. Load up your prefered icon editing program, e.g. icon sushi (freeware). Load in all the icons,
   then save as a single icon .ico.
